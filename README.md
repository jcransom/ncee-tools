# Bridging enterprise and engagement: three tools for universities

Three open source tools to help universities rethink and enhance their local enterprise and engagement activity.

1. Open-source checklists of enterprise provision
2. A visual path to understand institution-wide engagement activity
3. Detailed examples of how activity can begin, be extended, and be embedded. The result is a roadmap to bridging enterprise and engagement at local level.

Slides presented at the UIIN Conference 2021 here.
